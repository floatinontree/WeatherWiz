# WeatherWiz


Introducing WeatherWiz, the ultimate weather application for families! WeatherWiz is a user-friendly application that allows you to easily input your location and get real-time weather conditions, making it easy for families to stay informed and plan ahead. With this application, you can access weather information for all the locations you care about in one place, making it incredibly convenient for busy families.

One of the best features of WeatherWiz is the ability to customize the responses based on the age of the user. This means that the responses provided to a young child will be simpler and more playful than those provided to an adult, making it more engaging and accessible for families with young children.

Another great feature is the ability to add warnings, so you can look out for extreme weather conditions or other important information like when the temperature is going to be really high or really low. This allows you to stay informed and take the necessary precautions to keep your family safe.

Accessible as a website, WeatherWiz is designed to be easy for families to use and understand. Whether you're a busy parent or a young child, WeatherWiz is the perfect tool for staying informed about the weather conditions in the places you care about. Try it now, and see for yourself how WeatherWiz can make your life easier!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
